# React app with webpack and babel

Since this is a react app created with babel and webpack, it's very minimal
and limited in what it can do. as of right now, there are three features it has:

- Typescript-based
- Image loading
- Styling loading
- Dotenv loading (with no prefix as of yet!)

What I want to do later on is to add tailwind, cypress, and jest functionality.
